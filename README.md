# binarymarker-copula-dyn-pred
R code for "A copula-based approach for dynamic prediction of survival with a binary time-dependent covariate"

This repository contains R code for the simulation study. The version of R used to perform the analyses was 4.0.3. 

The R script "BinaryMarkerSimulationCode.R" contains the code for generating data under Simulation Scenario 1a and fitting the joint, landmark, and copula models. It requires loading "BinaryPredictionFunctions.R", which contains the functions to obtain the dynamic predictions for the joint, landmark, and copula models.
